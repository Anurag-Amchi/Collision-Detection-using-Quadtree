# Collision-Detection-using-Quadtree
This repository is about the Quadtree data structure and efficient collision detection using it
The program can be executed just like a normal C file. First you have to enter the playing ground which has to be less than 50 units. Then you will be asked to Enter the centre of the whole canvas. Following that you can add points to the canvas and finally an object on which you want to check collision on.
